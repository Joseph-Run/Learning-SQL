    "# Just my journey into Learning SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some major advantages to using traditional relational databases, which we interact with using SQL. The five most apparent are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- SQL is easy to understand.\n",
    "- Traditional databases allow us to access data directly.\n",
    "- Traditional databases allow us to audit and replicate our data.\n",
    "- SQL is a great tool for analyzing multiple tables at once.\n",
    "- SQL allows you to analyze more complex questions than dashboard tools like Google Analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Businesses Like Databases\n",
    "- Data integrity is ensured - only the data you want entered is entered, and only certain users are able to enter data into the database.\n",
    "- Data can be accessed quickly - SQL allows you to obtain results very quickly from the data stored in a database. Code can be optimized to quickly pull results.\n",
    "- Data is easily shared - multiple individuals can access data stored in a database, and the data is the same for all users allowing for consistent results for anyone with access to your database.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few key points about data stored in SQL databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data in databases is stored in tables that can be thought of just like Excel spreadsheets: For the most part, you can think of a database as a bunch of Excel spreadsheets. Each spreadsheet has rows and columns. Where each row holds data on a transaction, a person, a company, etc., while each column holds data pertaining to a particular aspect of one of the rows you care about like a name, location, a unique id, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- All the data in the same column must match in terms of data type: An entire column is considered quantitative, discrete, or as some sort of string. This means if you have one row with a string in a particular column, the entire column might change to a text data type. This can be very bad if you want to do math with this column!\n",
    "\n",
    "- Consistent column types are one of the main reasons working with databases is fast: Often databases hold a LOT of data. So, knowing that the columns are all of the same type of data means that obtaining data from a database can still be fast.\n",

    "\n",
    "Each of these SQL databases may have subtle differences in syntax and available functions -- for example, MySQL doesnâ€™t have some of the functions for modifying dates as Postgres. Most of what you see with Postgres will be directly applicable to using SQL in other frameworks and database environments. For the differences that do exist, you should check the documentation. Most SQL environments have great documentation online that you can easily access with a quick Google search.\n",

    "**Using Upper and Lower Case in SQL**   \n",
    "SQL queries can be run successfully whether characters are written in upper- or lower-case. In other words, SQL queries are not case-sensitive. The following query:\n",
    "\n",
    "    SELECT account_id\n",
    "    FROM orders\n",
    "\n",
    "is the same as: \n",

    "\n",
    "    SeLeCt AcCoUnt_id\n",
    "    FrOm oRdErS\n",
    "\n",
    "However, you may have noticed that we have been capitalizing **SELECT** and **FROM**, while we leave table and column names in lower case. This is because even though SQL is case-insensitive, it is common and best practice to capitalize all SQL commands, like SELECT and FROM, and keep everything else in your query lower case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Capitalizing command words makes queries easier to read, which will matter more as you write more complex queries. For now, it is just a good habit to start getting into, to make your SQL queries more readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "One other note: The text data stored in SQL tables can be either upper or lower case, and SQL is case-sensitive in regard to this text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Avoid Spaces in Table and Variable Names**    \n",
    "It is common to use underscores and avoid spaces in column names. It is a bit annoying to work with spaces in SQL. In Postgres if you have spaces in column or table names, you need to refer to these columns/tables with double quotes around them (Ex: FROM \"Table Name\" as opposed to FROM table_name). In other environments, you might see this as square brackets instead (Ex: FROM [Table Name]).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use White Space in Queries**\n",
    "SQL queries ignore spaces, so you can add as many spaces and blank lines between code as you want, and the queries are the same. This query\n",
    "\n",
    "    SELECT account_id FROM orders\n",

If you are familiar with Excel or Google Sheets, using **ORDER BY** is similar to sorting a sheet using a column. A key difference, however, is that **using ORDER BY in a SQL query only has temporary effects, for the results of that query, unlike sorting a sheet by column in Excel or Sheets.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, when you use ORDER BY in a SQL query, your output will be sorted that way, but then the next query you run will encounter the unsorted data again. It's important to keep in mind that this is different than using common spreadsheet software, where sorting the spreadsheet by column actually alters the data in that sheet until you undo or change that sorting. This highlights the meaning and function of a SQL \"query.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The **ORDER BY** statement always comes in a query after the **SELECT** and **FROM** statements, but before the LIMIT statement. If you are using the LIMIT statement, it will always appear last. As you learn additional commands, the order of these statements will matter more.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pro Tip**     \n",
